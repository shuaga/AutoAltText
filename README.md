# Notes
- This extension works only on twitter.com domain as of now.
- To make the extension start working, activate it using the keyboard or click on it.
- Once activated, it will keep loading the alt text for the images in the DOM. While scrolling, as new images come in, the alt text will be loaded for them automatically.
- While activating the extension using keyboard, tab doesn't close the extension popup. It seems to be stuck there. Use escape to close the extension popup.
- As of now, when a new search is carried out in twitter, the alt text is not loaded automatically. This is because the alt text loads on scrolling.


# Improvements:
- make it work for GIFs
- OCR?
- Are there any placeholder texts in twitter other than "Image"?
